Hi this is Aiden. 
Overall this class I have enjoyed it and have stressed over work. This final project has me pulling hair. My process was pretty good. I have to thank bootstrap for making my life easier and without it I don't think this project wouldn't look as closes as it does. The challenges I faced with this project is all involved images. I don't enjoy dealing with them. This project really made me use my memory of all the code I've learned and had to look up code. Overall I am not very good with more advanced code but I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy it at times.

Thank you for this class.
